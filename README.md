Greetings Humans!

I am Nabeel, I am from the planet Jupiter and here to try the food here on this so-called planet, how-ya-say-it, Earth.

I've tried the onion rings here but the "rings" on Saturn are better! HA. I've heard of something new called a, umm, whats-it-face... Oh yea! a car. you Humans are so behind! you guys "drive" we fly! Jupiter is soooo much better than this planet, better yet, even Pluto is better than here, HAAA!
